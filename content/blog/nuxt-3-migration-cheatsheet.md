## Introduction

Upgrading to Nuxt 3 from Nuxt 2 can be a little intimidating.

There are a ton of changes to keep track of, and it's easy to feel like you're lost in a maze of code.

But don't worry, I'm here to help!

I've started this cheat sheet
to simplify the upgrade process for myself and for others who are brave enough to tackle it.

It's a work in progress, and not intended to be exhaustive. I'll be updating it as I migrate more sites.

Just remember that the migration process will take some time, patience, and persistence, depending on the size of your project and your prior experience.

But hey, at least you'll learn a bunch.

And if you're just looking to upgrade some modules, I've written an [upgrade guide](#2-modules) for 23 of them.

Let's do this!

## Pre-migration

Before you start upgrading, it's important to familiarise yourself with the new features and changes in Nuxt 3 and prepare your
project for the upgrade.

### 1. Get familiar with Nuxt 3

Learn the key differences between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3 and the new technologies that power it.

::checkbox
Nuxt 3 Architecture
#tip
While there are many similarities to Nuxt 2, the underlying architecture is completely new, more complex and more powerful.

Start by learning the differences between:
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/internals#the-nuxt-interface) (core context)
- [Nuxt App](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/internals#the-nuxtapp-interface) (app context)
- [Nitro](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/server-engine) (server engine)
- Nuxi (command line interface)

You may want to re-familiarise yourself with the [Rendering modes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering) (SSR, SPA, Static).

Daniel Roe's talk [What happens when you start Nuxt 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVA_76hKEwE) is a great place to start.
::

::checkbox
Read the official migration guide
#tip
Having a rough understanding of the [migration process](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/overview) will allow you
avoid common pitfalls.

Keep this open as you'll reference this as you continue on with the migration process.
::

::checkbox
Play with Nuxt 3
#tip
Create a new fresh Nuxt 3 project using [nuxt.new](https://nuxt.new), play around with it.

This will help you get a feel for the new features and how they work.
::

::checkbox
Learn Vue 3 / Composition API
#tip
Vue 3 is a major upgrade from Vue 2. You will need to learn the new syntax and features to be able to use Nuxt 3, particularly
the [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html).
::

::checkbox
Learn the basics of TypeScript
#tip
Whether you like TypeScript or not is irrelevant. Nuxt 3 is written in TypeScript, trying to avoid it will only make your life harder.

You don't need to be an expert, but you should be able to read and understand the Nuxt 3 code.

You can learn the basics with [TypeScript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).
::

::checkbox
Learn about modules: CJS and ESM
#tip
Nuxt 3 requires ECMAScript modules, so you'll need to convert your CommonJS modules. See the Nuxt [ES modules](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/esm) page.

Many of the issues you'll come across are due to using dependencies which are CJS.
So understanding the difference between them can be critical.

Node modules can be a challenging subject, if you need further guidance see [this article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/).
::

### 2. Prepare your Nuxt 2 app

Before you start migrating, you should prepare your Nuxt 2 app to make the upgrade process easier.

::checkbox
Upgrade Nuxt 2
#tip
If you are on an earlier version, the first step is upgrading.

The latest Nuxt 2 uses [Vue 2.7](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-7-naruto.html), which supports the Composition API.

```bash
npm i nuxt@^2.15.4
# yarn add nuxt@^2.15.4
```
::

::checkbox
Upgrade Modules
#tip
Upgrade your modules to the latest version that supports Nuxt 2. This will make the upgrade process easier.

Be careful not to upgrade modules which may only support Nuxt 3 in future versions.
::

::checkbox
Enable component auto-imports
#tip
Nuxt 3 has auto-imports enabled by default, if you're not using this feature in Nuxt 2, you should enable it to identify
any component paths that need to be updated.

All manual component imports should be removed.

See [Components Discovery](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/components/#components-discovery) for more information.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default {
  components: true
}
```
::

::checkbox
Audit your dependencies
#tip
Having hard dependencies in your project that aren't compatible with Nuxt 3 / Vue 3 is going to massively slow you down.

You should go through all your node dependencies, checking the following:
- Vue plugin: Supports Vue 3
- Nuxt module: Supports Nuxt 3 or has an upgrade path. See [Migration - 2. modules](#2-modules) and the [Nuxt 3 modules](https://nuxt.com/modules).
- Other: Scan with [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) to find ESM support / alternatives. You can use CJS dependencies, but you'll need to [transpile](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/esm#transpiling-libraries) them.

This is a good opportunity
to drop any dependencies you don't need, migrate to dependencies which have better maintenance and / or are smaller.
::

## Migration

This cheat sheet requires a fresh Nuxt 3 project and migrating things over one by one.

In each step of migrating, you should test to see if everything is working.
If there are bugs, then you will be able to debug them easily.

### 1. Create the new app

The first step is creating the new apps boilerplate and migrate over safe config from `nuxt.config.ts`.

::checkbox
Create a Fresh Nuxt 3 App
#tip
You can do so with `npx nuxi init my-app`.

This will create a new Nuxt 3 project.
::

::checkbox
Create Boilerplate
#tip
By default, Nuxt 3 does not provide page routing and layouts. To make the migration easier, you'll be modifying the files to be Nuxt 2 compatible.

To enable them we update `app.vue` with `NuxtLayout` and `NuxtPage`.

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtLayout>
      <NuxtPage />
    </NuxtLayout>
  </div>
</template>
```

Create an empty default layout file that will be updated later.

```vue [layouts/default.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```

Create a basic index page, so we can see our changes.

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>hello world</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```
::

::checkbox
Migrate Runtime Config / env
#tip
Follow the [Migrate Runtime Config](https://nuxt.com/docs/bridge/overview#update-runtime-config) doc.

The `env` key in `nuxt.config.ts` is no longer supported, you should use runtime config exclusively.

```ts
// Nuxt 2
export default {
  privateRuntimeConfig: {
    apiKey: process.env.NUXT_API_KEY || 'super-secret-key'
  },
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    websiteURL: 'https://public-data.com'
  },
  env: {
    NUXT_API_KEY: process.env.NUXT_API_KEY
  }
}
```

```ts
// Nuxt 3
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    apiKey: process.env.NUXT_API_KEY || 'super-secret-key',
    // Warning: `public` is exposed on client and server
    public: {
      websiteURL: 'https://public-data.com'
    }
  }
})
```

You can safely ignore TypeScript issues this causes for now.
::

::checkbox
Migrate head
#tip
If you previously had head configuration in your `nuxt.config.ts`, you should migrate it to `app.head` config.

If you're using `hid` in your head config, unless you have a good reason, you should remove it. Read [@vueuse/head v1 release notes](/blog/vue-use-head-v1)
to learn more.

Note: Tags with `href` and `src` will not resolve relative links / aliases.
You will need to reference absolute links from the public directory. If you'd like to use aliases, you can use the [nuxt-unhead](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-unhead) module.

```ts
// nuxt 2
head: {
  meta: [
    { hid: 'description', name: 'description', content: 'My custom description' },
  ]
}
```

```ts
// nuxt 3
app: {
  head: {
    meta: [
      { name: 'description', content: 'My custom description' }
    ]
  }
}
```

::

::checkbox
Copy Static files
#tip
In Nuxt 3 the `/static` folder has been renamed to `/public`.
Make the `public` directory and copy all of these files over.
::

::checkbox
Copy CSS / Assets
#tip
In Nuxt 3, the assets folder serves the same function.
Simply copy over your assets' folder.

Once done, update the `css` field.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
css: [
  '~/assets/main.css',
]
```

Most pre-processors will work with no extra config.

You will just need to install the dependencies. For example, if you see an error like:

```bash
Preprocessor dependency "sass" not found. Did you install it?
```

You will need to run `npm install -D sass`.

If you're having issues with linked images within CSS,
you may need to use absolute links to the images in the public directory.

```css
/* Nuxt 2 - we have the file: assets/images/logo.png */
body {
  background-image: url('~/assets/images/logo.png');
}
```

```css
/* Nuxt 3 - we have the file: public/images/logo.png */
body {
    background-image: url('/images/logo.png');
}
```

You may have some node_module dependencies in your css entries, install each of these as needed.
::

### 2. Modules

Module migration can be a challenging part of the migration process. You will need to migrate each module one by one and test your app after each module.

Nuxt 2 modules are not compatible with Nuxt 3 out of the box, so many modules are not supported yet. I have tried to provide an
upgrade path for the most popular modules which are not supported.

::checkbox
Copy over modules
#tip

In Nuxt 3 all modules should belong under the `modules` key. You will need to copy over your modules from the `buildModules` and `modules` fields.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    // your modules
  ]
})
```
::

::checkbox
Remove redundant modules
#tip
The following modules can be safely removed as functionality they provide is redundant.

- [@nuxtjs/typescript](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org/)
- [@nuxtjs/typescript-runtime](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org/)
- [@nuxtjs/composition-api](https://composition-api.nuxtjs.org/)
- [@nuxtjs/dotenv](https://github.com/nuxt-community/dotenv-module)
- [nuxt-build-optimisations / nuxt-webpack-optimisations](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-webpack-optimisations)
::

::checkbox
Remove Modules No Longer Recommended
#tip
[@nuxtjs/axios](https://axios.nuxtjs.org/) and [@nuxt/http](https://http.nuxtjs.org/) are not recommended with Nuxt 3.

It's best practice to use the [$fetch / useFetch](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/component-options/) API.

If are determined to use `$http` you can use [nuxt-alt/http](https://github.com/nuxt-alt/http).

See the [Nuxt 3 and Axios](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/discussions/4514) discussion for additional context.
::

::checkbox
Use alternative modules
#tip

#### @nuxtjs/auth

Official `@nuxt/auth` support is a [work-in-progress](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/roadmap#core-modules).

In the meantime, you can use:

- [sidebase/nuxt-auth](https://github.com/sidebase/nuxt-auth)
- [nuxt-alt/auth](https://github.com/nuxt-alt/auth)
- [@nuxtjs/supabase](https://supabase.nuxtjs.org/)

#### @nuxtjs/pwa

The community [nuxt-pwa-module](https://github.com/kevinmarrec/nuxt-pwa-module) module seems to be the best option.

A core module for PWA seems to be undecided, if it goes ahead there's no ETA.

#### @nuxtjs/i18n

Official support is in beta, check the [docs](https://v8.i18n.nuxtjs.org/).

#### @nuxtjs/proxy

This feature is coming to nitro route rules. You can track it here: https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/113.

In the meantime, you can use the [nuxt-alt/proxy](https://github.com/nuxt-alt/proxy) module.

#### @nuxtjs/eslint-module

The Nuxt 2 version of this module is called  `@nuxtjs/eslint-config`, you should remove this.

Instead, follow the [documentation](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint-config) for `@nuxt/eslint-config`.

#### @nuxtjs/sitemap

Not currently supporting Nuxt 3.

Instead, you can use:
- [nuxt-simple-sitemap](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-simple-sitemap) or [nuxt-seo-kit](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-seo-kit).
- [@funken-studio/sitemap-nuxt-3](https://github.com/funkenstudio/sitemap-module-nuxt-3)

#### @nuxtjs/robots

Not currently supporting Nuxt 3.

Instead, you can use:
- [nuxt-simple-robots](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-simple-robots) or [nuxt-seo-kit](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-seo-kit).

Alternatively, create your own robots.txt file at `public/robots.txt`.

```text [public/robots.txt]
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

OR you can generate robots dynamically.

```ts [server/routes/robots.txt.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(
  e => `User-agent: *\nDisallow: /\nSitemap: https://YOUR_SITE/sitemap_index.xml`
)
```

#### @nuxtjs/vuetify

Official support is coming soon. You can use [nuxt-alt/vuetify](https://github.com/nuxt-alt/vuetify) in the meantime.

#### @nuxtjs/device

Not supporting Nuxt 3.

Create your own plugin to detect the device instead, you can use the [ua-parser-js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) package directly.

```ts [composables/useDevice.ts]
import UAParser from 'ua-parser-js'

export function useDevice() {
  const parser = new UAParser()
  const { os, browser, device } = parser.getResult()

  return {
    os,
    browser,
    device,
    isMobile: device.type === 'mobile',
    isDesktop: device.type === 'desktop',
    isTablet: device.type === 'tablet',
    // etc
  }
}
```

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { isDesktop, browser } = useDevice()
</script>
```

### @nuxtjs/moment

Not supporting Nuxt 3.

Create your own plugin to use Moment instead.

```ts [plugins/moment.ts]
import moment from 'moment'
import 'moment/locale/en'

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  moment.locale('en')
  moment.tz.setDefault('UTC')
  return {
    provide: {
      moment,
    }
  }
})
```

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
// access moment via $moment
const { $moment } = useNuxtApp()
</script>
```

#### @nuxtjs/fontawesome

I'd recommend using [nuxt-icon](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/icon).

Alternatively,
see the [Using FontAwesome in Nuxt 3](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/discussions/3823) discussion for plugin code sample.

#### @nuxtjs/dayjs

See [Nuxt3 support](https://github.com/nuxt-community/dayjs-module/issues/376) for plugin code sample.

#### @nuxtjs/toast

See [Examples of using the @nuxtjs/toast or any vue toast plugin?](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/discussions/2732) discussion for plugin code sample.

#### @nuxtjs/gtm

You can create your own code to handle gtm.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      script: [
        {
          innerHTML: `(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
            new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
  j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
  'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','YOUR_GTM_ID');`
        },
      ],
    },
  }
})
```

#### bootstrap-vue

See [nuxt3 starter?](https://github.com/cdmoro/bootstrap-vue-3/issues/232) issue for code sample.

Work in progress.

#### @nuxtjs/google-analytics

See [Vue Plugins](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins/#vue-plugins) from the docs for an example of how to use Google Analytics with Nuxt 3.

Alternatively,
see [this comment](https://github.com/nuxt-community/gtm-module/issues/82#issuecomment-1373202592)
on how you can implement it with cookie control.
::

::checkbox
Upgrade supported modules
#tip
If the module you're using supports Nuxt 3, it's important to check the migration notes.
It's likely that the upgrade will include some
breaking changes.
::

### 3. State management

If you're using Vuex 3, you will need to upgrade your state management, as Vue 3 does not support it.

::checkbox
Consider if you need a state management library
#tip
Nuxt 3 ships with its own statement management with the [useState](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/state-management) composable.

If you're using a state management library, you should consider if you need it.

Additionally, if you are dealing with data client side, you can always reference global refs. This isn't recommended for
server-side rendering as state is shared between users.

```ts [composables/useCounter.client.ts]
import { ref } from 'vue'

// You can import this counter from any file and the data will stay in sync
export const counter = ref(0)

export function useCounter() {
  return {
    counter,
    increment() {
      counter.value++
    },
    decrement() {
      counter.value--
    }
  }
}
```
::

::checkbox
Otherwise, migrate to Pinia or Vuex 4
#tip
[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/ssr/nuxt.html#nuxt-2-without-bridge) is the recommended state management solution for Nuxt 3, but you can use [Vuex 4](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/migrating-to-4-0-from-3-x.html) if you prefer.
::

### 4. Components

Components will only be parsed if they are imported. This means it's safe to copy over all our components and mixin files from Nuxt 2.

::checkbox
Copy components
#tip
The folders have the same name and will be auto-imported. You don't need to add anything to `nuxt.config.ts`.

If your components aren't being found,
it may be because component auto-imports are done with path-prefixing by default,
see [Component Names](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components#component-names).
::

::checkbox
Follow Component Options Migration
#tip
See the [Component Options Migration](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/component-options) guide for more information.
::

### 5. Pages and dependencies

You will be copying over your pages one by one and their dependencies.

As you copy each page, you will run into errors. These errors may be related to breaking changes between Nuxt 2 and 3 or to missing dependencies.

For example, you'll have missing layout, plugin and potentially component dependencies.

It's important you reference the [Nuxt 3 Migration Guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/overview) as you go.
Remember to ask for help in the community channels if you get stuck.

::checkbox
Home Page
#tip
Start with the home page, `pages/index.vue`.
This will give you some momentum and help you get started.
::

::checkbox
Copy static route pages
#tip
You'll start with routes which aren't dynamic which tend to be less complex and easier.

For example: `pages/about.vue`, `pages/contact.vue`, etc.
::

::checkbox
Copy dynamic route pages
#tip
Nuxt 3 uses a new file system routing system, which means that all our pages need to be converted to the new format.

See [Dynamic Routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/pages-and-layouts#dynamic-routes) for more information.
::

### 6. Server Routes / Middleware

Nuxt 3 uses a completely new server engine and HTTP framework.
This means that all our server routes and middleware need to be converted to the new format.

::checkbox
Migrate server routes
#tip
See [Migrate Server Routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/server).

You'll likely need to completely rewrite your server routes.
::

::checkbox
Migrate server middleware
#tip
See [Migrate Server Routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/migration/server).

You'll likely need to completely rewrite your server middleware.
::

## Post Migration

### 1. Recommendations

::checkbox
Migrate to Composition API
#tip
While this is not required, it is highly recommended.
The Composition API is a much better way to write Vue code and Nuxt provides
better support for it.

Tips:
- [vue-composition-convertor](https://github.com/miyaoka/vue-composition-converter) may give you a head start
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is pretty good at converting Vue 2 options API to Vue 3 composition API
::

::checkbox
Migrate everything to TypeScript
#tip
Nuxt 3 is TypeScript first, it is the best practice to have all of your code in TypeScript.

If you're using the Options API, you can simply add `lang="ts"` to your Vue SFCs. Otherwise, if you are using the options API, you
can make use of the `defineNuxtComponent` function.

```vue [components/MyComponent.vue]
<script lang="ts">
export default defineNuxtComponent({
  props: {
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    console.log(this.name)
  }
})
</script>
```
::

::checkbox
Load static assets from an absolute path
#tip
In Nuxt 2 it was common to load everything from `~/assets`, however with Nuxt 3 the default is to use absolute paths.

This way the bundler does not need to parse them. This will save you time when migrating and improve your build performance.

Simply move images which aren't going to change to `static` and load them from `/` instead of `~/assets`.
::

::checkbox
Use Vue Macros
#tip
To make the migration from Vue 2 as simple as possible, you can make use of [vue-macros](https://vue-macros.sxzz.moe/guide/getting-started.html).

It provides a number of useful build-time macros, which speeds up the time to convert the code.

```vue [components/MyComponent.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { modelValue, count } = defineModel<{
  modelValue: string
  count: number
}>()

console.log(modelValue.value)
modelValue.value = 'newValue'
</script>
```
::

::checkbox
Switch to UnJS / VueUse where appropriate
#tip
The [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) and [UnJS packages](https://unjs.io/) all support Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3. If you can migrate to using them over other dependencies,
you'll save yourself a lot of time.
::

### 2. Testing

Testing in Nuxt 3 is still under development. There is some documentation around it, but it is fairly minimal.

::checkbox
Migrate to Vitest
#tip
Nuxt 3 uses Vitest for testing. If you're using Jest or Mocha, you'll need to migrate.

See the [Why Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html) guide for more information.
::

::checkbox
Use @nuxt/test-utils
#tip
Follow the documentation on the [Testing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/testing) page,  to get started.
::

::checkbox
Add vitest-environment-nuxt (optional)
#tip
The [vitest-environment-nuxt](https://github.com/danielroe/vitest-environment-nuxt) package will likely take over as the official testing environment for Nuxt 3.

It's still a work-in-progress with minimal documentation, but you may consider using it.
::

## Conclusion
