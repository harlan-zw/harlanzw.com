Hello, my amazing sponsors! Welcome to first ever newsletter. I have some exciting things to share with you.

## GitHub Sponsors Perk Updates

Going forward, I'll be improving your sponsor perks in three ways.

**Early Access Monthly Newsletter**

At the start of each month, I'll be sending a newsletter (just like this one).

This will cover my achievements, financials, and plans for the month ahead.

I'll post these publicly towards the end of the month on my blog.

**New Discord Role / Channels**

I have a Discord server that I use to provide support to many of my open-source packages. If you have any technical issues you'd like help on, feel free to ask here.

I have the following new perks within discord:

- New role: "sponsor"
- New discussion channel: üíé„Éªpriority-support.

Link to join: https://discord.gg/FC8FgHuC

**Bi-monthly Video Call**

Every 2 months, I'm going to schedule a time to do a video call with any sponsors who would like to join. In it, you can ask me any questions or just hang out, no pressure smile

- 30-60 minutes
- Held in discord (link above)
- First call is scheduled for 9pm AEDT, calendar invite link

### Financials

How sustainable is my current open-source work

My financial goal for February was saving $10k, as I have some travel plans coming up. I planned to spend 50% of my time on open-source.

I had a ~100-hour project booked with one of my clients. Around 40 hours into the project it was clear that I couldn't work with them anymore on it. I decided to fire them and ended up refunding them 40 hours of work to be done with it.

While this was quite a hit, the peace of mind of not having to work with them anymore on it was worth it. I'll avoid any bad-mouthing, I'll just say that they weren't pleasant to work with.

**OSS**

- ‚åõ 111 hrs
- üí∏ A$617.06
- A$5.55 / hour

**Freelancing**

- ‚åõ 78.25 hrs (+ 35.25 hrs)
- üí∏ A$3015 (- $517.5)
- A$38.53 / hour (-$42.67)

### March plans

By the end of this month, I'll be starting my travels for 3 months in Asia, going from Thailand, South Korea, and Indonesia.

During this time, I'll continue to work on open-source, just while sitting on a beach drinking a coconut.

Until then I have some goals:

- Significantly improve the Unhead performance in Nuxt (feat: server/client only composables, feat(head): improved Unhead integration)
- Docs site for Nuxt SEO Kit
- Make Nuxt OG Image an official Nuxt module, have a few bugs to fix
- Land a few more Nuxt PRs

### Summary

I hope you've enjoyed the first newsletter! Again, please join me for the first sponsors call on the 7th if you're interested.

Best wishes to all of you and I hope you have an amazing month ahead.
