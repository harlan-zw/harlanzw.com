## Reflecting Objectively

I've been reflecting on the year of 2022. I thought this would be a good exercise  

When I think what I have to show for the year, the immediate thought is not enough. 

But this isn't quite right. A case of imposter syndrome mixed with comparison of others.

A common thought loop for people trying to create.

To overcome this, I look at numbers; good old emotionless numbers.

- What did I actually spend my time on?
- What was the outcome of that time spent?
- What is the trajectory?

I can't wait to see what the new year brings, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.

Here's to a fantastic 2023!
