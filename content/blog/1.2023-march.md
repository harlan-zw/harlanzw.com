## Personal Updates

### Moving out

Since becoming a freelancer and focusing on open-source, my days are mostly relaxed. I can choose what I want to work
on and actively avoid any hard deadlines.

March was the complete opposite.

Deadlines on moving out, on planning and preparing for a year of travel, finishing off freelancing commitments
and staying on top of my open-source work.

But it all got done.

As of the end of March, my girlfriend (Alina) and I handed over the keys to our leafy-green apartment in Canberra, Australia.
With no where in particular to now call home.

### Travel

We started our travel last week, landing in Bangkok, Thailand. Bangkok is a hectic city, not recommended for relaxing.
But I enjoyed the city, the food and the people.

It has been interesting trying to work on open-source while travelling. Any down-time I have I whip out the laptop.

Thailand's internet has been surprisingly good which as made that easier.

As of writing this we're in Ko Chang, Thailand. Ko Chang is a dense mountainous jungle island with deep-blue water paired with complex orange gradient sunsets.

We're staying in a bungalow near the beach for $30 AUD a night.

## Work Updates / Financials

With the cost of living in Thailand much cheaper than Australia, I'm spending less money while travelling than I would be
if I was still living in Canberra.

### Open-Source

- ‚åõ 88 hrs  (-23 hrs)
- üí∏ $787 AUD (+$168)
- $8.94 AUD / hour (+$3.39 / hour)

Most of my open-source time last month went into Nuxt modules and Nuxt itself.

My current focus is trying to get all the Nuxt SEO Kit modules to a v2 and release v2 of Nuxt SEO Kit.

**Main projects**

- **24 hours [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt)** - working on better Unhead integration, a couple of minor bugs and triage
- **22 hours [nuxt-simple-sitemap](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-simple-sitemap)** - v2 with many SSR improvements and bug fixes. Is now closer to being feature-complete.
- **14 hours [Unhead](https://github.com/unjs/unhead)** - working towards a v2 which will significantly reduce the bundle size.
- **12 hours [nuxt-og-image](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-og-image)** - v2 is out under a beta tag, with many bug fixes and improvements. Still want to add a couple of features for the v2 release.
- **3 hours [nuxt-simple-robots](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-simple-robots)** - v2 is out and now feature-complete.

### Freelancing

- ‚åõ 6 hrs (-72.25 hrs)
- üí∏ $645 AUD (-$2370)
- $107 AUD / hour (+$68 / hour)

Didn't have too much freelancing to do. Finished off some important projects and now have a bit of a break.

## April plans

Figuring out what I can actually finish while travelling is a challenge. I'm trying to keep my goals small and achievable.

I would like to get Nuxt SEO Kit v2 out by the end of April. This will be quite a bit of work as each dependent module
needs to be updated to v2, which I have many plans for. It also includes a proper documentation site.

I would also like to get the Unhead v2 update out. The bundle size improvements will be a win for Nuxt and the Vue ecosystem.

## Final thoughts

I'm really enjoying travelling and working while travelling. I hope to sustain it as long as I can and I can't thank you,
the sponsors, enough for your support.

While the amount I can get done will take a hit, I'm still dedicated to providing as much value
as I can for your contributions.

Please get in touch with my if you have any questions, feedback or suggestions. Would love to chat!
