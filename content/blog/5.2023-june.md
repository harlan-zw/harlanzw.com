## Personal Updates

### Flores

We spent the last week of our South East Asia trip in Flores, an island in Indonesia, east of Bali.

Flores is best known for its Komodo dragons and the glowing lakes of Mt Kelimutu volcano.

We did a road trip from East (Maumere) to West (Labuan Bajo), weaving along "spaghetti roads" through the mountains and
dense jungle.

We passed tiny villages as we went that offered a unique glimpse into the life of the Floresian and the Manggarai people.

Nearly everyone lived off the land, with rice being grown as the main source of food.

Occasionally we'd see someone roasting their coffee beans which I also had a go at.

When inspecting the jungle, we'd always see something growing:
mangoes, bananas, passion-fruit, cocoa, vanilla pods, taro, etc.

Our highlights were:
- Kelimutu volcano, which has 3 crater lakes at the top. These lakes change colour over time, and we were lucky enough to see them in their blue, green and black state.
- Rinca Island, seeing the Komodo dragons in their natural habitat.
- Bena Traditional Village, walking amongst amazing thatched roof houses.

### Australia: A wedding and camping

After Flores, we flew back to Australia for a wedding.

It's winter time here, so it was a bit of a shock to the system after 3 months of high heat and humidity.

After the wedding, we took a trip to the Warrumbungles with some friends.

The Warrumbungles is a national park north-east of Sydney which is best known for its amazing night sky views.

We camped there for a few days, doing some hikes and exploring the area.

Afterwards we spent time in the Blue Mountains and Sydney catching up with family and friends,
and planning the Europe leg of our trip.

## Work Updates

June was an important month of work,
getting things ready for the next major releases of my Nuxt modules.

The main blocker was Nuxt OG Image which had continued to plague me with issues.

With some luck and _many_ hours of work, I was able to get it to a state where it's mostly working correctly on all
major runtimes and was able to unblock myself.

This was a huge relief, and I'm looking forward to pushing out all Nuxt SEO modules in the coming months.

## Numbers / Financials

- ‚≠ê 6112 GitHub stars (+705)

It's really nice ce to be back in Australia and to have some more time to dedicate to work.

Thanks as always to my amazing sponsors.
