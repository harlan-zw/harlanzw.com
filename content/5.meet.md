# Let's meet

Meeting new people is one of my favourite things about open-source. I love chatting about open-source, business,
craft-beer or anything.

If you want to chat, feel free free to book a [video call](https://cal.com/harlan-wilton/15min) with me. Otherwise,
just jump in my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5jDAMswWwX) and say hi.

## IRL Schedule

I'm around Sydney, Australia for the next couple of months. Hit me up if you feel like catching up!
