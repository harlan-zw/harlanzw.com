# Harlan Wilton :i-line-md-coffee-loop

Hey, I'm Harlan, a full-stack web developer living in :i-emojione-v1-flag-for-australia{class="ml-2 mr-1" alt="Australian Flag"} _Sydney, Australia_. 

I'm passionate about building [open-source](https://github.com/harlan-zw){title="Visit my Github"} packages in the Vue, Nuxt and Vite ecosystems.

I'm part of the [:windi-icon{alt="WindiCSS icon"} WindiCSS](https://windicss.com){title="Open windicss.com"} and [:i-logos-vueuse{class="mx-1" alt="VueUse icon"} VueUse](https://vueuse.org){title="Open VueUse.org"} teams and proudly [sponsored](/sponsors){title="Visit sponsors page"} for the work I do. 

Sometimes I [write articles](/blog){title="Visit Blog Page"}.

When not coding, you can find me:

- ☕🍺 At a café or brewery
- 📚 Adding books to my [bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122898515-harlan-wilton){title="See the books I've read on goodreads.com"}
- 🥐 Eating almond croissants 
- 🏞️ Or maybe in front of a waterfall...

## Open Source Journey

At the end of 2020, I finished up my full-time job at a [startup](https://kintell.com/){title="Visit kintell.com" }. I wanted to explore other ways of working,
with the idea of building a SaaS product.

Though, without an idea I was passionate about and no audience, it felt like a waste of time.

Instead, I decided to focus on learning as much as I could within the Vue ecosystem. 

I started building my [old blog](https://old.harlanzw.com){title="Visit my old blog site"}
in the earliest version of VitePress and did an article comparing [Vite to webpack](/blog/how-the-heck-does-vite-work){title="Visit the article I wrote about Vite"}.

In setting up Twitter and sharing that article, I was hooked.

I started writing more, contributing issues and building my own [Vue plugin](/blog/vue-automatic-component-imports){title="See the article I wrote on Vue Automatic Component Imports"}.

Through these I grew my audience and started focusing on [Nuxt modules](/projects) and joined the [WindiCSS](htttp://windicss.com) team.

Since then, I've been working on all sorts of projects. While the progress has been slow while I've been learning, I'm proud of what I've accomplished, 
and I'm excited to share more with the community.

## Freelance Laravel and Nuxt Developer

When not creating open-source, I work for myself as a freelancer. 

Working with my clients, I create scalable, profit driven web apps and SEO, performant marketing sites built with :i-logos-nuxt-icon{alt="Nuxt Icon"} Nuxt and :i-logos-laravel{class="h-1.2em w-1.2em ml-2 mr-1" alt="Laravel Icon"} Laravel.

While I have limited capacity for new work, I'd love to hear from you if you think I could help your business grow.
